# travel_app

A Flutter app to review places you have visited.

This project has made for practicing clean codding.

## While building this app I practiced on following technologies and patterns -

- clean coding
- flutter_riverpod _(for state management)_
- get_it flutter package _(for dependency injection)_
- floor flutter package _(for local database)_
